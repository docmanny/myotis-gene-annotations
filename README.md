Myotis Gene Annotations
=======================

A repository dedicated to gene annotation tracking for neartic _Myotis_ species. 

VERSION HISTORY
----------------

### 2024-03-14: 

  - `v0.3`: Gene names replaced where possible
  - `v0.2`: Added David's syntentic BLAT genes

### 2024-01-29: 

  - `v0.1`: Curated GFF3 files, still needs to be reconciled with David's nomenclature

To-Do
------

### Consistent gene nomenclature:

- Add _bona fide_ gene names to GFF "Name" field; for genes without a human ortholog, add Myotis orthogroup IDs to GFF "Name" field

### Functional information

- Add in data from InterProtScan to genes as additional GFF fields via AGAT


Ongoing (future) work
-------

- Update gene names and IDs as gene families go through gene tree reconciliation analyses.
